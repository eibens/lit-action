# lit-action JSON

The *lit-action JSON* format adds only a very thin layer on top of a regular bash script. It breaks a monolithic build *action* into a series of named build *steps*. This allows one to (1) compose concrete actions from generic reusable steps, and (2) generate reports with a higher degree of granularity.

These types are inspired by the GitHub Actions YAML format, but not full compatible and less capable. For example, bash steps in GitHub Actions require a property `shell: "bash"` to mark them as such. Lit-action is further limited to bash steps only, but can thus easily be run locally.
